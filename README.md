Config.json layout:

```json
{
    "token": "TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": "m!",
    "activity": [
        "Insert activity here"
    ],
    "clientId": "CLIENT ID",
    "guildId": "GUILD ID",
    "ownerID" : [
    "ID HERE"
    ],
    "nasa": "" // Get this from https://api.nasa.gov/
}
```
> :warning:UPDATE:warning: Blacklists will soon be held via an API which is in development, once it is done we will begin to move the system to the API

Make sure to rename `example.config.json` to `config.json` and fill everything in... ClientID and GuildID are for deploying commands
