Config.json layout:

```json
{
    "token": "TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": "m!",
    "activity": [
        "Insert activity here"
    ],
    "clientId": "CLIENT ID",
    "guildId": "GUILD ID",
    "ownerID" : [
    "ID HERE"
    ],
    "nasa": ""
}
```

**Note:** To obtain a nasa api token go to the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) website

Make sure to rename `example.config.json` to `config.json` and fill everything in... ClientID and GuildID are for deploying commands
