### Config.json layout

```json
{
    "token": "TOKEN HERE",
    "prefix": "m!",
    "activity": [
        "Insert activity here"
    ],
    "clientId": "CLIENT ID",
    "guildId": "GUILD ID",
    "ownerID" : [
    "ID HERE"
    ],
    "nasa": "",
    "heartbeatlink": ""
}
```

> [!NOTE] \
> To obtain the nasa api key go to https://api.nasa.gov/ and sign up for an api key. \
> To obtain the heartbeat link go to your https://betteruptime.com/ account and get your heartbeat link.

Make sure to rename `example.config.json` to `config.json` and fill everything in... ClientID and GuildID are for deploying commands
